Summary:
- Siege Machine is a turn-based strategy game where players spawn tanks in order to capture enemy bases.
- Each unit can be upgraded to higher levels using scraps, which are obtainable through sacrificing your units or destroying the opponent's units. 
- Higher level units can take more hits, deal more damage, and when attacking a lower level unit, will instantly destroy them and occupy their tile.

Player Experience:
Our intended player experience is to provide a medium for strategic planning and decision making. Every decision the player makes should be carefully calculated to achieve victory, and to reinforce this notion we make sure both players have completely equal access to game-state information. We incentivise player interaction by providing asymmetrical resources in an attempt to avoid stalemates while simultaneously promoting a general direction of playstyles.
